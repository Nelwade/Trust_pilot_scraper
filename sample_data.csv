1,Argos,Purchased a television last year. That has now gone faulty after only 16 months and Argos have refused to help unless I have an independent report completed at my expense and then send the report to their head office and they have no email address for the head office so it has to be by post. Call taker was so unhelpful and clearly not aware of SOGA,"I ordered a weights bench and weights from Argos simply because the delivery time from Amazon was too slow.It arrived from Argos, as described and the driver was friendly.Also it would have been more expensive to get the weights bench and weights separately from Amazon. I also got 56 days interest-free credit on my Argos store card! 😁Recommended. A+++",Website hard to navigate. However delivery was on time and without problems. Richard Auchincloss,At every stage the process was straightforward and efficient.  Ordering - no problems.  Delivering - within the time frame promised and carried out efficiently.  Installation instructions clear and easy to follow.  One very minor gripe - the pictures in the handbook did not completely match the machine viz a viz display panel.,UPDATE: did exactly what argos told me do.  They keep repeating the same lies like a stuck cd.  It is like taking to a brick wall.  It is crystal clear that argos has to many customers and making far to much profit.

3,Moonpig.com,Arrived on time. Nice cuddly,The delivery was great and on time unfortunately the stand on my photo frame snapped of because  the back was fitted so tightly.  I had no time to replace or exchange so had to superglue it back on and now hope it stays put. Moonpig are usually good but on this occasion I was not happy,Excellent. Easy to use for uploading photos and the dispatch of the card I purchased was very quick.  I would recommend Moonpig from my experience with them.,"I received multiple emails pushing me to order, stating “order now, still time for Father’s Day” etc etc. So I spent over £18 on a large card and a gift, ordered on Friday, was told by moonpig it would be delivered on Sunday guaranteed (Fathers Day), only to receive an email from Royal Mail the following day stating it would be delivered on Tuesday 21 June, two days after Father’s Day and after my father has left for a three-week holiday, Utterly useless. Be ashamed Moonpig of your marketing hype masking the reality of disappointed customers to whom you fail to deliver. Never again, and I would advise others against as well. This company is simply using marketing as lies.More fool me for following for the hype, when something looks too good to be true, it almost always is.",Easy to use app and cards arrived as ordered and next day. Many thanks.
4,Marks and Spencer,"I made few purchases on 14th of June at Oxford Street store London and the lovely lady at the till convinced me to buy the summer beauty bag on special discount price as I spent specific amount to qualify.I must say this bag is such a clever idea.Getting  all the best beauty brands usually not affordable at original prices in candy pink mesh bag which is a treat itself are like a dream coming true. Amazing choice of items added. Marks and spencer should bring these kind of beauty bags with more different options i-e  prices/ choice options like beauty, hair care. I am truly impressed and amused. This beauty box is like getting a surprise gift/ treat from  Mom.A fully appreciated,recommend and must buy item.",disgusted. ordered my parcel 10 days ago for fathers day and it never showed up. leaving my father in law with nothing to open. was told the earliest next delivery was in 5 days time. Being a food parcel it would all be stale and way past fathers day. the agent I spoke to online was useless and very rude. completely. disappointed.,"The service from the online service is shocking, ordered 2 items, both just left on my doorstep in full view of passers by and yet the delivery email says ‘left is safe place’. I haven’t even designated a safe space. First time rote to M&S received an apology but the same thing happened on the next delivery. Cannot express how disappointed I am with M&S a brand I used to trust and respect. No longer.","I recently purchased several two-button men's polo shirts from M&S.  They are all cotton. The seams are nice and flat and the shirts are all very well made. No designer logos. Nice weight too. They are less than £20 each which is a great buy!  Ralph and Lauren and Lacoste shirts are priced at four times as much. Unless you really need to advertise a logo, I recommend them highly!",Pork belly smells disgusting!!!I will never buy pork from m & s again.Check your farm please!
5,Asda,these ret4rds/mental patients Asda workers will not help you!  they don’t refund and if you have to cancel a collection they will mark as collected! I called them to rebook or have a refund and the wh0re said everything would be done in two hours but didn’t do sh** but sit her flat ass on whatever it was and continue with her day.,Terrible customer service from ASDA. Falsely accused by a rude and aggressive manager of not paying for goods when I clearly had.,"In my opinion, ASDA is the worse of the big four. I find the selection limiting, especially when I shop at my local Tesco or Morrisons. This means, I have to shop at multiple stores to get the items I need. The quality of meat, especially steaks, are thin, limited amount of fat, and looks like a bottom of a shoe. I do find, my local ASDA prices can be higher on items than my local Tesco. I avoid my local ASDA as much as possible due to its limited selection, poor quality, and prices.   As for using their online grocery delivery service. I will not use it anymore due to their bizzarre subsitions and multiple substitutions","Disgusting, their online robot is infuriating & unusable they send substitutes which are laughable and everything you ordered for home delivery has the shortest used by date possible. 2 days for a large pack of ham as well as the rest of the fresh produce in my order? Looks like im only eating 2 days this week.Bye bye from me iv tolerated quite a few late deliveries, short dates numerous appalling substitutes but a full shop almost that has to be eaten within 2 days was your final insult. To the packer who picked my items, well done moving yourself 1 step further to the unemployment queue by losing another customer","Can I just say a big thank you to all the girls at this counter for there assistance  and advice one of them even seen us waiting to get served she was going for her break she took off her jacket washed her hands and began serving , there were all friendly, polite,  and helpful, hope you are all appreciated by managers & owners once again girls cheers cbruce"
6,Matalan,I am appalled and disgraced  at the lack of customer service provided by Matalan after the years of custom I have given to them. I bought my Mum and Dad £50 worth of gift cards each Christmas of 2019 for my Mum to then die January 2020 (one month later). Mum put the cards somewhere safe as Dad had other things on his mind at that time and it wasn't until my Dad passed away last week (May 2022) that we found the gift cards..... I explained this to Matalan Customer Services and asked if they would honour the cards as a sign of good will to be told NO!!! They then offered me £10 in place of the £100 I had paid which is rejected and told them to close my account ..... They have still rejected my request and now cancelled my reward card.... What an unprofessional inconsiderate company with no Customer Service and total disregard for their customers. It is appalling.,"If I could rate ZERO I would.  Staff are rude and unhelpful since self service.  I can assure you I am not an idiot and dislike being treated like one.  My card is split, wont swipe I ask for help, yet the staff are rude, lazy and arrogant. One woman said she worked for Sainsburys for 15 years but was laid off... can understand why as she was very rude and unhelpful.  I may shop online again but will CERTAINLY NOT visit the Swansea Cwmdu store ever again.",My order hasn’t arrived yet. No update no dispatch information at all.,"Ordered a suitcase online paid for it ,only to be told after 4 days of waiting that the suitcase was not in stock, however I checked evey day multiple times and the suitcase I ordered was infact in stock ,even straight after I received the email telling me I was not going to receive my item,  it was in stock surprise surprise,  and guess what this is not the first time this has happened to me ,completely unexpectable, order number 52111584 let's see if you get back to me ,doubt it disgusting customer service","Ordered some baby clothes using a refund card from Christmas gifts that were too small and also my own money. Vests arrived burst out of packet and with one missing which had obviously happened before they were packaged to send to me. They insisted on only refunding the refund card even though I no longer had it, told me that was my problem because I was “told the terms and conditions when I bought the gift card” I didn’t buy it, I was told nothing of the kind and why not just refund me the part I paid with cash?? Months of emails. Given up. Absolutely garbage customer service."
7,Amazon.co.uk,This company is a nightmare to deal with when things go wrong you get made promises on people calling you back never do you get passed from pillow to post trying to sort the issue out they say you will get your money back but boy im fighting with them they say everything will be resolved within 24 hours this 24 hours have turned into 2 weeks and still getting passed around to different people not happy I have been a loyal customer over the years but am now at the stage of cancelling all my subscriptions with them,"Been converting an old mountain bike into an electric bicycle, so needed some new brakes went on Amazon uk site to order a set of front and rear V- brakes made by a manufacturer called RUJOI received the package a few days later but totally different make to what was ordered. These were all plastic not alloy as stated inferior Chinese  rubbish dangerous  and should not be for sale, if anyone buys RUJOI brakes from Amazon please make sure they have RUJOI written on the arms  if not send them straight back as they are unfit for purpose and could cause an accident or even worse get someone killed. RUJOI are a reputable good quality brake and have had bad press by Amazon. When I posted a review on Amazon they refused to publish it because it did not meet their guidelines.","An item never arrived. I wrote about it as a review,and Amazon didn't accept it, removed my comment . Awful company.","This is a copy of a message I received from a seller. He had stated in a previous message that he would not refund unless I removed my review. When I stated that I did not take to being blackmailed he/she wrote the following:Dear seller:Hello!1. You didn't understand me correctly, you misunderstood me.2. I did not blackmail you to delete the bad review, but your review is not true, and I hope you can send a photo so that I can better solve the problem for you, but I have not received the photo, how can I prove it Is what you said true? If you don't send photos, how can I know which one the warehouse sent for you? Our warehouse sends so many goods every day, are you sure you sent it wrong?3. I am not a poor seller. This has nothing to do with poor sellers. It is impossible to send this product to you. I now think that you want to defraud my product. I will apply for Amazon to investigate your account, whether it is normal or not. If your account has been refunded more recently, Amazon will officially close your account, so please don't deceive me.4. You are very irrational, and I suspect that you often defraud goods and defraud products on Amazon. Your behavior is very bad, which has seriously affected the Amazon platform. Hope you can stay sane.5. I never stated that I would not give you a refund, but you never gave me a chance to solve the problem for you from the beginning, and you did not send the photos related to the product, how can I be sure that I sent the wrong item. I will apply to the Amazon official to view your Amazon account and investigate your related behavior through the relevant legal team, please know.6. The address is as follows:Address: BLUEWHITEL, 101SHOUSE, 2ARISTOLWAY, SLOUGH, SLOUGHPostcode: SL13QEName: Raf Huer I am apparently the person in the wrong.  If I get my money back I will be closing my account.","Absolutely garbage, never delivered on the day its supposed to be if at all."
8,Dunelm,"So, my partner and I ordered a wooden stool. Very reasonable price, but yet they couldn't deliver it, we had to travel 1hr to go and pick it up. So, it took us about 1.5hrs to get there with public transport, we get there, the stool is broken, refund is given, nice. This visit to the store could have been prevented if Dunelm did a QA check upon arrival of the product to the store we picked it up from. The only positives in this entire experience were that they have stellar employees and the refund was issued instantly, without any hassle. Super-friendly front-facing staff. But, the rest of the customer experience was absolutely terrible. Dunelm, just do better.",Ordered 2 suitcases from Dunelm online was only available for delivery and charged for it to be delivered on a certain day.Which then did not arrive until 4 days later.Then found a £45 ticket attached to a case I paid £55 for?Dunelm never answered my query about any of my problems,"I ordered four items which came in three different deliveries and I was given no choice regarding when for any. Delivery of my furniture items required two person delivery but only one was provided (not sure who was at fault here - Dunelm or the carrier). I was asked by the person delivering if I could help carry the items. As I have a prolapsed disc in my spine the answer was unfortunately a ""no"". The person struggled to carry them and one box was placed the wrong way up. The box stated in large writing words to the effect that placing the item this way up could cause damage.One of the pieces of furniture was slightly damaged and there was an issue with assembly. I tried to contact Dunelm. Their website says the quickest way to make contact was via the online chat but this was never working. I sent two messages via the online form but never got a reply other than one telling me the quickest way to make contact is via the online chat! I gave up in the end.",Great store easy website efficient click & collect,"I always go to the Horsham Store the Staff are very friendly and helpful, the store is clean and they keep it very tidy and well stocked"
9,Halfords Retail,"the chaps at the Paisley Halfords were Ace. Especially the boss man that rose to the challenge!I walked in 8:30am, and said I have a wee challenge for uz. Got a tricky bulb change to get done and need to be back on the motorway in less than 1/2 an hour to get to my hospital job. The chap got this done and dusted in less than 15 min!! I'm usually good with handy jobs but this was ridiculously hard to do and not user friendly at all on the vw Passat front lights. But he made it look easy. Well done, excellent rapid service.","After buying a webcam, I have only just got round to setting it up, The App does not work correctly so is not connecting the webcam. when I looked this seems to be an issue that has been ongoing, so my question is If their app is not working why are you selling the cams?",They get 2 stars because the mechanic who 'assembled' my bike was attentive. Very disappointed and I am going to draw more attention to this.,"Customer service was the worst I’ve ever experienced. Completely uninterested, rude and hugely unhelpful. Paid to have the bike built, and the form has been completed to say they have checked suitability and fitting for my daughter, she hasn’t even stood near the bike let alone sat on it or had anything adjusted. Asked for a stand at the time of order, no stand fitted, when I mentioned it was on the original order, they went and found one and tried to charge me a further £5 to fit. Appalling customer service throughout and somewhere I will not be going back.","Products were fine, ready in an hour, staff at click and collect counter were pre occupied i seem to be a bit of inconvenience"
10,Screwfix,I went to Screwfix in Bletchley to get nails for a hired nailer. I asked for help with the size of nails I needed for the nail gun only to be told ‘we don’t give advice’ . I then informed her we needed a certain size nails for the gun and asked for the manager to help. She said he wasn’t in and all the Saturday staff were 17 and did not know anything and could not give advice!! Very poor show Screwfix and also worrying to leave just 17 year olds running a DIY store. I most likely won’t use you again.,Always a first class service I wish I could get that sort of service every were.,"As part of renovating an old property I've made 100's visits to screwfix. The store staff (especially at East Grinstead) are super. I recently decided to order a couple of items for home delivery. What a shambles. Firstly an email saying one was actually out of stock and they wouldn't get it again, followed by a tub of adhesive where the lid had come off going everywhere. Clearly rubbish packaging - no tape, paper or anything. And to top it off, they called me saying the item actually was in stock (after I'd already gone elsewhere). I won't be ordering for home delivery again, simply very poor customer experience.",Just today I recieved scam from Screwfix saying that 'fathers day free Dewalt Screw if you send the message to min 20 people via whatssapp' Do not even bother it is scam once you forward message to 20 people in your address book then they say system crashed. Basicaly screw fix untrusted company suggested use b&q,"Always had a fantastic service at the Evesham store, moved up to Fraserburgh and the service is even better. Must have spent nearly 2k in the last 3 weeks on 30 or 40 orders and everyone has been spot on.Did have 2 issues, a fault mountfield strimmer that would not start, had a chat with support who told me to empty the petrol tank and leave it 24 hours. Then take it back to the store for a replacement / refund (went for a replacement) the staff where on the ball no arguments and replacement arrived 3 days later for me to collect.2nd issue was a special offer with no stock in the country, spoke to customer care via FB messenger and they placed a credit on my account. Once the item was in stock but the offer was over, called up sales and got the offer price.Some of the best service in store and online by any British company, well done."

12,Smyths Toys Superstores,"I went to the shop in llandudno and wanted to buy a gift card for Steam. When I arrived at the shop, I told the staff that I wanted a gift card for Steam but he gave me the one for Roblox. I was talking to him about the credit card sometimes doesn’t work on Steam and the stuff said yeah, sometimes it happens while I was paying for it. So I am 100% sure I said I wanted a gift for Steam instead of Roblox as I don’t even play games on Roblox.  After I arrived home, I spotted that he gave me the wrong gift card so I phoned Smyths and the stuff who picked up the phone said they couldn’t do anything about it as the gift card has been activated and they couldn’t resell it ( I don’t really care as it is not my mistake, it is their stuff who gave me the wrong thing ).    Therefore, I required to talk to the manager but that manager said the same ridiculous thing. They tried to say it was my fault by not checking the card in the shop but the stuff didn’t show me the card before he activated it, I wasn’t able to get the card until after I paid. If I couldn’t return it after it has been activated, is there any difference between I check it in the shop or spot it at home?    Eventually, the boss phoned me back and told me that I can bring it back to the shop and return it.   This is probably the most ridiculous shop I have ever been to, with the stuff that doesn’t help with the problem at all but making it worse. The only thing that they think about is they couldn’t resell it but they never think about it is their fault not mine. Why I have to take the responsibility for others’ mistakes?","Bought a nupnup high chair which soon after broke. Was not given a receipt and then they conveniently couldn’t place my order receipt which I sent all info for! Will never purchase from here again, it’s a faulty item and should be exchanged!!!! Disgusting","Emailed smythes Sheffield about the bike I bought my daughter , they didn't put it together correctly , back brakes falling off and handle bars moving forward as which my daughter went over when the handle bar slipped forward, told them this and they said that they wouldn't have sent a bike out like that , I said well you did , she said we wouldn't I said you did, they won t refund my money and told me I have to come back another day after a mechanic has looked at it ( fools ) a bike assembler I think you mean !!  Do not by a bike from smythes , to a local bike shop who will take care of you","Smyths in Castle Vale Retail Park was good. I had no trouble in buying what I went there for. My only complaint I have is the Queues are long to and this blocks off the aisles so people start standing around trying to get past, leading a mass gathering.","Smyths store Swindon: I have to give one star in order to activate the review but the service is worth zero. Ignorant, undertrained staff. Poor management. Asked to see a manager and they’re all on break and apparently can’t be disturbed! Long queues that the staff or management do nothing to eradicate. It’s a new store, hopefully it will get better….?"
13,Trainline,Do not assume that Trainline automatically gives you the lowest fare option. Go direct to the rail operator site to check if cheaper (eg. Southernrailway.com). Also check if Oyster works out better (TfL single fare finder).Unfortunately Trainline don't warn you about checking for alternatives.,Service de réservation alternatif impeccable.,Never had a problem with using trainline. Have bought many tickets sometimes on the spur of the moment to go to a random trip to the beach at 5am and love being able to do this so easily.  You just install your credit card details then add your security code and Boosh you have your QR code for the ticket machine.  My only niggle is when I have had to cancel a train ticket and have only got a portion of my ticket back due to a charge or something.  Like what is that charge for because it is not for a human who is doing any work it is an automated system.  Just seems a little unfair is all but that's my only small problem. Apart from that jolly well done Trainline. I pretty much use you weekly for tickets all over the place great website.,Easy and efficient. The only way I book my train tickets now!,"Multiple times now I either had to request a refund or an exchange of a ticket and each time I call up the Trainline customer service lines they are not only helpful but also very courteous, positive and reassuring. I mean you can almost hear the smile they serve their customers with through the phone! Impeccable team and they clearly always have your best interest at heart."
14,ailcard,"Railcard not showing in app after being ""successfully added"" using the code.",The app is entirely faulty and does not display railcard. There is no way to contact Railcard other than through Twitter DMs (which apparently people are getting no response from anyway) or by sending a message on website. There is no phone line for help and clearly this is an issue that they are neglecting to resolve. Maybe just get a physical copy of your railcard to avoid being scammed out of your money.,"Using the railcard is very good value but negotiating the website is a nightmare. It took us over an hour to renew, the site kept going round in circles- at one point we were asked for photos when the Senior Railcard does not require them. When the cards arrived my husband’s runs on from the existing time on the card as promised by the renewal website mine runs from the day I renewed, thus losing me 3 weeks discounted travel. Poor service.","I'm surprised that so many people leave such negative review. I presume, it's because of a - disastrous I hear - implementation of 'digital railcard', probably due to 'outsourced' and poorly implemented design of a 'digital service'. I opted for 'old school' plastic, ordered on Thursday night, I think, and got it delivered either Saturday or Sunday (incredible!). The only failure was that I was unable to set up railcard account to apply for the card, with a ridiculous message: 'account could not be created' (?!). Apparently a bug they haven't solved for years. Fortunately application was quick and easy via another rail company (East Midlands Rlwy, or something similar).Card itself is really a great value, 80 quid or so for 3 years for a family of 4, 35% off. Arguably, less value when teenagers grow over 16 yr old, but highly recommended overall.p.s. I wouldn't bother with digital because of the problems, but yes, it would be useful to have a digital backup for free, same as with printed ticket + free pdf, qr code scannable.","The app is completely down and has been for weeks, yet there is no mention of this while you are purchasing your railcard. Absolutely disgusting treatment. Down £30 quid and the trains won't even accept the receipt email as proof of ownership."
15,JD Sports,I've not even had my 1/4 zip nike sweater a month. I'm a size 8 so it isnt stretched. Stitching already gone at both arms. It was £65. Really disappointed.,My order has still not been sent to the store its been about 4 weeks now.Not impressed.,"I ordered on vans zip jacket and waited for 25 days , and after without any information the order got cancelled",Normally great service from JDs but this purchase I paid to get next day delivery but only received part of my order the rest of the order came the following day.,"Ok missing items  but hopefully will get refunded on items ,still in the process but all others ok xx"

17,Premier Inn,"Good night sleep.....How can this be when the buildings aren't built for it. My last two stays ive been unfortunate to have a ground floor room and the noise from above and simply walking around was shocking. I thought it was a one off, but it clearly isn't. Make sure you request a room at the top of the building to avoid this.","Premier Inn Manchester Piccadilly is a perfect location, just a stones throw from Piccadilly train station, city centre and bars. The room was spotlessly clean, bed very comfy and shower was really powerful and hot. I had a meal deal so breakfast and evening meal included, cheap and cheerful with nothing to complain about, meals were good and all staff were really polite, friendly and helpful. The only downside was the very poor wifi connection. I was away with work and needed to connect but was unable to, very frustrating.",Great nights sleep as usual at a Premier Inn. Didn’t hear any noise at all and slept soundly on the very comfortable bed. The room was spotless and also the bathroom. Breakfast excellent. Would recommend.,"We have just stayed in Cambridge orchard park premier inn and it was excellent, clean and comfortable, very cool too after spending 7 hours stuck in the car!The night staff deserve special mention for their helpfulness when we got back in from Newmarket Nights!  Breakfast was very good.. all very tasty and plentiful and lots of staff on duty. All in all an enjoyable, value for money stay.  We wouldn’t hesitate to visit again","We had a 4 night stay at the premier in Pickering. We stayed in one of the better rooms. It was a really great stay, easy parking, easy check in, great breakfasts, great dinners . £24.95 for Full Breakfast and 2 course evening meal plus a drink. Great value. Staff very so very friendly and very helpful, nothing was to much trouble. Highly recommended ."
18,Drmartens,"I've been wearing Docs since I was an Art student 40 years ago.  My second pair lasted for over 18 years, and I've had others that lasted well over a decade.  When they wore out, it tended to be the tread wearing out and a crack appearing across the sole: fair enough - I'd have walked several thousands of miles in them. However the left of the most recent pair - just under 2 years old now - hasdeveloped an almighty split, a crack running longtitudinally along the length of the side of the sole, below the welt.  It renders them totally useless for wet weather.  So, why? They've undergone no particular stress, they've not been involved in any accident, I haven't changed the way I walk... they've just split.  I've certainly never seen anything like this on a shoe beforehand. The black adjacent to the yellow stitching is separating from the brown sole below. I'm loathed to shell out another £150 if this is going to happen on the next pair. C'mon Docs - get your act together.  Is it acceptable to put out substandard stuff these days?  Er, no. Long term customer, now EXTREMELY disappointed.  I understand other brands are available...","Worst returns process and customer service team, ever! I bought my Dr. Martens boots but once I finally got them after one month of wait, I had to return them as they were too wide for my feet. I followed the return process, attached the label Dr. martens team provided and it’s been almost two months that the package is stuck at Swiss customs. I’ve contacted Dr martens customer service team numerous times and at the beginning they were “checking” and all of a sudden they stop replying my emails. I strongly recommend people to avoid buying this brand if you don’t know perfectly well how the sizes fit to your feet. They ship from USA (which is something not mentioned in the webpage) and it is a nightmare to return packages to USA.","Bought dr Martens in 2019. I got myself 1460 smooth leather lace up boots. At first I loved them despite the fact that they were hard and I had to break them in. Wore them occasionally, as I am someone who has many pairs of shoes. What I am most disappointed about is the fact that leather cracked very badly ( I was using leather protection from the start) in the areas where boots bent. Also, leather started flaking off. I have never seen it before on any shoes I wore. I am not heavy boots wearer. I'm not going for concerts or festivals. My boots are more for fashion than for anything else so they aren't worn all the time hence I cannotsee the reason for this kind of condition. My only regret is that I haven't contacted Dr Martens when they were still on warranty, but if I recall they weren'tlike that then. I contacted them recently, to let them know how disappointed I was and how bad their product is (not for refund). I got reply that warranty run out (like I wasn't aware of it) and that I should be using their wonder balm so this wouldn't happen. Seriously?! I was using proper shoe protection but it's their wonder balm that would ""save"" my boots from damage. I don't think so! Product they make isn't worth the money they charge it. Be aware that after over 2 years I still get blisters from boots, this is how hard this leather is. My partner also bought shoes from them and he is also disappointed. His shoes are so hard that he is unable to break them in. Overall, waste of money for the overrated product. They look nice but they lack quality company claims to have.",Very happy with 6 eyelets boots received today Cheers Theo F for great customer service.Kevin C,"I've been a proud and happy user of Dr. Martens for years but this is where it ends.The quality of the products is well below what I was expecting. Recently both me and my partner purchased their plant based, vegan friendly boots. a few months later, they started discolouring and a layer started peeling off. Contacting their support team with a request for a way to protect the boot or perhaps some coating material that we can apply, triggered the default response of ""out of warranty - wear and tear"". Wear and tear is a term that was never used previously with any of my docs. They have obviously chosen the ""fast fashion"" - sell to the masses strategy over repeating business as they have lost us as customers.Shame."
